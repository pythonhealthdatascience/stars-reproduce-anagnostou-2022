This could include one or more process flow, activity cycle or equivalent diagrams sufficient to describe the model to readers. Avoid complicated diagrams in the main text. The goal is to describe the breadth and depth of the model with respect to the system being studied.\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Base model logic\nGive details of the base model logic. Give additional model logic details sufficient to communicate to the reader how the model works.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Scenario logic\nGive details of the logical difference between the base case model and scenarios (if any). This could be incorporated as text or where differences are substantial could be incorporated in the same manner as 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Algorithms\nProvide further detail on any algorithms in the model that (for example) mimic complex or manual processes in the real world (i.e.¬†scheduling of arrivals/ appointments/ operations/ maintenance, operation of a conveyor system, machine breakdowns, etc.). Sufficient detail should be included (or referred to in other published work) for the algorithms to be reproducible. Pseudo-code may be used to describe an algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.1 Components - entities\nGive details of all entities within the simulation including a description of their role in the model and a description of all their attributes.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Components - activities\nDescribe the activities that entities engage in within the model. Provide details of entity routing into and out of the activity.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Components - resources\nList all the resources included within the model and which activities make use of them.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.4 Components - queues\nGive details of the assumed queuing discipline used in the model (e.g.¬†First in First Out, Last in First Out, prioritisation, etc.). Where one or more queues have a different discipline from the rest, provide a list of queues, indicating the queuing discipline used for each. If reneging, balking or jockeying occur, etc., provide details of the rules.

Provide a description of their use and include parameter values. For stochastic inputs provide details of any continuous, discrete or empirical distributions used along with all associated parameters.

In these cases authors should adhere to item 5.1 software recommendations.State all priority rules included if entities/activities compete for resources.If the model is parallel, distributed and/or use grid or cloud computing, etc., state and preferably reference the technology used. For parallel and distributed simulations the time management algorithms used. If the HLA is used then state the version of the standard, which run-time infrastructure (and version), and any supporting documents (FOMs, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n5.4 System specification\nState the model run time and specification of hardware used. This is particularly important for large scale models that require substantial computing power. For parallel, distributed and/or use grid or cloud computing, etc. state the details of all systems used in the implementation (processors, network, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nCode access\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1 Computer model sharing statement\nDescribe how someone could obtain the model described in the paper, the simulation software and any other associated software (or hardware) needed to reproduce the results.
