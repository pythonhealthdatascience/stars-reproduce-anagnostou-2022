## 09.14-09.38: Resuming recreation of figure

Continuing from yesterday. I included the running of the model within `reproduction.ipynb`, and finished up the Figure so it matches the paper.

Feel this is reproduced at 09.38.

## Timings for reproduction

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 106

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.14', '09.38')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
