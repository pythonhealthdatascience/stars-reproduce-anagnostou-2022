Redid badge evaluation.

:::

## 10.52-10.56: Revisit evaluation

Revisited and revised the badge criteria to (a) make them up-to-date, and (b) make sure they are *specific* to the descriptions from each badge. Hence, redoing evaluations for all eight studies.

Notes:

* Docs2 - No, as no inventory of artefacts (which is a specific requirement of that badge)
* Reproduce - No, as required more than minor troubleshooting: had to write code to produce the figure. Although it was pretty quick and straightforward, I think writing code for the figure is more than I would assume a volunteer checking a paper for a badge would do.

## Untimed: Update summary report

With new badge evaluation results.
