## Untimed: Test-run of reproduction package

Tom did a test-run on XPS13 with Ubuntu 22.04:

* Environment creation - confirm works as expected
* Pytest - completed successfully
* Reproduction.ipynb - reproduces charts
* Dockerfile - container built successfully
* Docker container - launched successfully and ran reproduction.ipynb

## Untimed: Wrap-up

This marks the reproduction as complete, so we are able to:

* Inform the author/s
* Archive another version of the repository
